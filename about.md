I build algorithmic methods for estimation and reconstruction, especially **structured optimization**, **low-rank priors**, and **uncertainty analysis** for noisy, indirect measurements.

## Education

- **University of Southern California (USC)** — M.S. Electrical Engineering, Dec 2025  
  MS GPA: 3.7/4 (overall GPA 3.54/4), with ~3.5 years of PhD-track research in quantitative modeling, optimization, and inverse problems.
- **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur** — Integrated B.Tech + M.Tech, 2017–2022  
  CGPA: 9.18/10 in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering.

## Technical Strengths

- **Programming:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), MATLAB
- **Engineering practice:** Git, unit testing, profiling, benchmarking, reproducible research pipelines
- **Methods:** FFT/DCT/wavelets, time-frequency analysis, estimation theory, inverse problems, quantization, probabilistic noise modeling, PCA, low-rank modeling, CRLB-based uncertainty analysis

## Honors

- **Annenberg Fellow**, USC (2022)
