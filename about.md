I work on algorithmic methods for estimation and reconstruction, especially **structured optimization (ADMM/LADMM)**, **low-rank/structured priors**, and **uncertainty analysis (CRLB)**.

## Education
- **University of Southern California** — M.S. Electrical Engineering (Dec 2025), MS GPA 3.7/4  
  Completed ~3.5 years of PhD-track research in quantitative modeling, optimization, and inverse problems.
- **IIT Kharagpur** — Integrated B.Tech + M.Tech (2017–2022), CGPA 9.18/10

## Skills
- **Python** (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), **MATLAB**
- Git, profiling, benchmarking, reproducible pipelines
- Signal/image processing (FFT/DCT/wavelets), estimation & inverse problems, probabilistic noise modeling, low-rank methods
